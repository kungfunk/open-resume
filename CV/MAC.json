      "description": "Hi!, I'm Victor and I've been around for a almost 20 years building products on the web, both big and small. I have experience in Backend, Frontend and even in DevOps, when things were less complex. \nThis last 5 years i've been more focused on the Frontend side, as individual contributor and also leading teams (and even the whole area) working very closely with business. \nI worked as freelance, consultant and a part of product team, which is the one I enjoyed the most, so im looking for new opportunities in small and mid-size business oriented companies.",
