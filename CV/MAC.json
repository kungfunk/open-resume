      "description": "Hi! I'm Victor and I've been developing for the web for almost 15 years already. I have experience in really small startups building the whole product and also in very big companies leading technical teams on isolated processes. I have experience in both BE (PHP and Java mostly) and FE, but during these last years IÂ´ve been more focused on FE (Angular).\nI'm very passionate about clean architectures (DDD, hexagonal...) and quality processes (TDD, code review, pair programming) to achieve great maintainable code.",
