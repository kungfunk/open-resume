I have experience in Backend and Frontend, building from scratch or in very large organizations.\nThis last 7 years i've been more focused on the Frontend side, as individual contributor and leading teams (and even the whole areas) working very closely with business.\nI worked as freelance, consultant and a part of product team, which is the one I enjoyed the most, so im looking for new opportunities in small and mid-size business oriented companies.",
